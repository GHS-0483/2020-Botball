    motor(0,-30);//negative moves backwards
    motor(1,-30);//unless Quintin happens, in which case forwards is backwards and backwards is forwards

    motor(1,45);//gradual turn towards whatever side motor 0 is on- in this case, the left
    msleep(1500);//1500 is a good starting point- it is 1500 milliseconds, or 1.5 seconds
    
    motor(0,55);//keep R and L the same
    motor(1,-55);//pivots CW. Reversing neg would pivot CCW
